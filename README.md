* Use worksheet to experiment with language/logic.
* Types: Int, Boolean, Double, Char, Byte, Short, Long, Float
* Eveything is Objects: You can apply methods to any types: 1.to(10)
* Strings are used exactly as in Java but here Strings has more method operations
* Infix NotationsL 1.to(10) is same as **1 to 10**(only works with method that has one parameter). Also 2.+(10) is same as 2 + 2. **to** and **+** are operators/methods.
